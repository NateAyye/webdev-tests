Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what
you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all
represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines
for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can
always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
